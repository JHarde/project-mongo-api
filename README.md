# Mongo API Project

Using MongoDB as a database to store and retrieve data I have created an API with RESTful endpoints. 

## The Problem

I decided to use a json data file including Netflix-shows. I created different routes and endpoints in which the user can search for a specific title in the array and find all the movies/tvshows that were released in a specific year. 

Using mongoose I created a model for the show. Using find() the user is able to search and retrieve an array of titles or movies/tvshows from a specific year. Using the method findOne() the user can retrive an object of one specific title in the array of shows.
